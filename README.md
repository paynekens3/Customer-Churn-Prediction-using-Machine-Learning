# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
## Customer Churn Prediction for Telecom Industry

## Overview
  This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help telecom companies reduce churn by identifying customers who are most likely to leave, enabling companies to take proactive steps to retain those customers.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is based on telecom customer information, including demographics, account details, and usage patterns. It contains various features such as:
- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- Gender: The gender of the customer.
- SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen.
- Partner: Whether the customer has a partner.

## Models Used
Logistic Regression: A baseline model for churn prediction.
Random Forest: An ensemble model that improves accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Recall: The percentage of actual churners correctly identified by the model.
F1-score: A balanced metric combining precision and recall.

## Conclusion
  This churn prediction model helps telecom companies identify high-risk customers early and take action to improve retention. With better-targeted marketing efforts and service improvements, companies can reduce churn rates and improve overall customer satisfaction.
